   LUXURY MEDIA WALL — Site configuration
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   EVERYTHING you are likely to want to change lives in this one file:
   the phone number, every image path, and all project / material copy.
   Edit here and the whole site updates. No other file needs touching.

   IMAGE NAMING CONVENTION
   Each photograph exists at three widths so the browser only downloads
   what it needs:
       assets/img/<name>-480.jpg    phones
       assets/img/<name>-900.jpg    tablets + gallery cards
       assets/img/<name>-1400.jpg   desktop + project modal
   To swap a photograph, drop in replacements at those three widths keeping
   the same file name. Full-resolution masters are kept in /_masters.
